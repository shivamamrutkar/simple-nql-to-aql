# üöÄ Natural Language to SQL Query with Gemini Pro and Streamlit

This project is a powerful and intuitive web application built with Streamlit that allows users to interact with their SQLite databases using plain English. It leverages the Google Gemini Pro model to translate natural language questions into executable SQL queries, retrieves the data, and displays it in a user-friendly format, complete with automatic data visualizations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Natural Language Queries**: Ask complex questions about your data in plain English (e.g., "Show me the top 5 artists by total sales").
  * **SQLite Database Integration**: Simply upload your `.db`, `.sqlite`, or `.sqlite3` file to get started.
  * **Automatic Schema Detection**: The app automatically reads and understands your database's schema to provide context to the AI model for more accurate queries.
  * **Generated SQL Display**: View the exact SQL query generated by the Gemini Pro model for transparency and learning.
  * **Tabular Data Results**: See the results of your query displayed in a clean, scrollable table powered by Pandas.
  * **Automatic Data Visualization**: If the query result is suitable, a relevant chart (Bar, Line, or Pie) is automatically generated using Plotly.
  * **Secure & User-Friendly**: API keys are handled securely using Streamlit's secrets management, and the interface is designed for ease of use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8 or higher
  * Git

### 2\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

All the required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Configure Your API Key üîë

To use the Google Gemini API, you need to configure your API key securely.

1.  Obtain a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

2.  Create a folder in your project's root directory named `.streamlit`.

3.  Inside the `.streamlit` folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.

4.  Add your API key to the `secrets.toml` file in the following format:

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    *Note: The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this file from being uploaded to GitHub.*

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the application running.

### Usage Steps:

1.  **Upload Database**: Use the sidebar to upload your SQLite database file.
2.  **Ask a Question**: Once the database is connected and the schema is displayed, type your question in plain English into the input box.
3.  **Get Results**: Click "Generate & Execute Query" to see the generated SQL, the data results in a table, and a visualization chart.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is ready for deployment on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/).

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Make sure your project, including the `requirements.txt` file, is pushed to a public GitHub repository.
2.  **Create a New App**: On Streamlit Cloud, link your GitHub account and select the repository.
3.  **Add Secrets**: In the advanced settings, add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to the secrets manager, just as you did in the local `secrets.toml` file.
4.  **Deploy**: Click "Deploy\!" and your application will be live.
